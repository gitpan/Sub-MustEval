This dies with a stack trace (via Carp::confess) if
the attributed subroutine cannot find an eval on the
stack. 

This is useful for sub's that know they throw what
should be non-fatal exceptions or for calls inside
of long-running processes that need to decide quickly
if they have been called properly.

This is generally more useful in testing than production,
but can also be useful for tracking down failures.
